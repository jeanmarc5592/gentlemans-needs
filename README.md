Gentleman's Needs (My little Vanilla JavaScript Project)
----------------------

In this project it was all about learning Vanilla JS with more complexity and understanding the language itself even better.
So I decided to create a little webshop page for luxury watches (Yeah, I love watches). 

The main focus was on creating filters without using any libraries or frameworks. 

I've done everything by myself. That means I've planned it out, designed it in Adobe Xd, wrote the HTML & SCSS Code and gave it 
functionality with JavaScript. 


FUNCTIONALITY
---------------
- When you click on the left side on 'Watches' you get all watches which are in store
- If you'd like to apply some filters you can open the filter-dropdown by clicking on 'Filters' at the top
- Inside the dropdown you can select the filter values you want and also combine them
- They are all saved inside the localStorage, so they are still displayed after reloading the page
- You can clear all filters by clicking on 'Clear' 


WHAT I'VE LEARNED
-----------------
- Manipulating arrays and objects on a deeper scale 
- Converting objects into arrays
- How to check if one element of an array is inside of another array 
- Applying the DRY Principle
- Starting as simple as possible and adding more complexity on the run 
- Implementing the localStorage 
- Training my logical thinking for programming 
... and much more!
